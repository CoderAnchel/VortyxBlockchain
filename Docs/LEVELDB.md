# RLP
Encoding Conversion: When converting some values (like balance, nonce), you're converting to strings before RLP encoding. This might lead to inconsistent serialization.
State Encoding: The state seems to be getting encoded differently. In the original object, it appears as "Active", but after RLP process, it shows as "0x416374697665" (hex-encoded ASCII for "Active").
Public Key Representation: There's a noticeable difference in the public key hex representation before and after RLP processing.

Recommendations:

Consider using consistent encoding methods for numeric and string values.
Implement a more robust conversion method for the state.
Ensure that your toRLP() and WalletfromRLP() methods handle type conversions precisely.
